Research on writing an extension to contextify to snapshot context and restore it

1. Check sample test stub in the test folder
2. Refer test/takeSnapshot.js to check how to take a snapshot at runtime
3. Refer test/loadSnapshot.js to check how to restore the context from a snapshot file
4. Upon restoring the context, when trying to run any script on the restored context gives a run-time segmentation fault which needs to be fixed
5. Global proxy is not being restored from the snapshot - might need to look at why it is not being restored
6. Initial investigation shows that it is not part of the snapshot and might have to be created by writing v8 code
